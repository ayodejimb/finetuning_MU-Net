# Finetuning MU-NET Neural Network for Hippocampi Segmentation on mice brain magnetic resonance (MR) images

- This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file ("fine_tuning_MU-NET_implementation.ipynb") illustrating the approaches that I have employed in finetuning the MU-NET neural network for hippocampi segmentation on mice brain MR images for my research project. After finetuning the model, the model was able to correctly learn and segment the hippocampi regions on my MR images.

- MU-NET is originally developed by "De Feo, R., Shatillo, A., Sierra, A., Valverde, J. M., Gr√∂hn, O., Giove, F., & Tohka, J. (2021).
